                                            As the Principal of IIS, my primary focus is student learning. All students must be prepared to face the challenges ahead & be successful. Students must know how to think, to innovate, and to collaborate. There is no longer a single pathway to that end, but whatever pathway our students choose must be stepped with effort, dedication, relevance, and relationship.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Our commitment is to provide a safe & intellectually challenging environment that will empower the students to become self-sufficient to thrive in the <strong>21st century</strong>. High standards & expectations for each student in regard to academic performance, co-curricular participation, and responsible citizenship are the foundation of our school.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            We do not believe in imparting knowledge merely as information but insist on <strong>value-based education</strong> which the world needs today. With a fine blending of Indian tradition & modernity with impetus on sound character building, we aim to help students become men & women in a changing society.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            It is wonderful that the students get lots of exposure to learn, perform & find recognition for their talent & hard work on one hand, & develop the quality of multitasking, tolerance, and cooperation on the other.

                                            Education is a commitment to excellence in teaching & learning. No good life is possible without education. It endorses the intelligence of human beings, develops his skills and enables him to be industrious. Life poses innumerable challenges & our goal in IIS is to help one to successfully brave through the rough seas of struggle, strife & hurdles. Here, a student is made to blossom intellectually, morally & spiritually. We offer our students a stress free learning environment which encourages creativity & critical thinking.

                                            At IIS we believe that true education is a right blend of intelligence & character, we educate our students to maximize innate behaviour along with positive social behavior, thus developing them as global citizens. I strongly believe that a school is not just about bricks, mortar & concrete but about building character, enriching mind & enriching experiences that last a lifetime. My mission is to create a niche where learning well not be just series of instructions but a passion, that goes beyond books, beyond instructions & beyond learning horizon.

                                            Given that our students come from a very wide range of backgrounds & abilities; each one of them has something within them that is a very special. It is this focus on trying to uncover that special talent & using it to build confidence & self-esteem that makes IIS much more than a school, but rather a family of Ishwarians.
